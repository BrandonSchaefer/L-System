Lindenmayer Systems:

Example:
  Start: F
  Rules:
    - F = G-F-G
    - G = F+G+F

Two iterations:
0: F
1: G-F-G
2: F+G+F-G-F-G-F+G+F

Define what each symbol means:
F/G = Walk 80 pixels foward
-   = Turn 90 degress left
+   = Turn 90 degress right

What will i need:
Given a string, iteration num and a set of rules return the iterated string.
  - l_system.GenerateString(2); // returns 2 iterations based on that given l_system

LSystem Class needs:
  - A way to be given rules ... in sort a breed of rules. Where there is such
    a mapping 'Char' = 'String' or if no rules 'Char' = 'Char'.

Need a GeneratedStringRenderer... Which will take a generated string and render it based on a set up rules:

Rules - A rule is a Charact that then produces a String ex: A -> ABAB

Lets attempt to use XML to pass a set of rules:

<Rules>
  <"F -> G-F-G">
  <"G -> F+G+F">
</Rules>
